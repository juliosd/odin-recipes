    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hush puppies are a great Southern tradition along with buttermilk coleslaw and Southern-fried catfish. Why not use all that buttermilk together in all your recipes? Try them all!</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>4 green onions, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 quart vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and eggs in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold buttermilk mixture, onion, and green onions into cornmeal mixture until just mixed.</li>
        <li>Drop 6 to 8 tablespoon-sized balls of batter into the hot oil; fry until each hush puppy is golden brown, turning the hush puppies to cook evenly, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on brown paper bags to drain. Repeat with any remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Transfer hush puppies to a baking sheet and keep warm in the preheated oven until ready to serve your <em>puppers</em>.</li>
    </ol>
