Born in the dog-eat-dog world of San Diego, California, Chef Shiba lived to cook. Often scrimping for scraps, Chef Shiba made the best of what he could as a young pup. Seven puppy years later, his scrappiness has turned him into one of today's top culinary canines. From cat bread to hush puppies, Chef Shiba delights the taste buds of all ages and pedigrees.
